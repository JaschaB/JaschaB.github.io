I decided not to post this… but here we are. I told myself it wasn’t good enough. In actuality I was just scared. A reader saved it when she emailed about her own Impostor Syndrome. I sent her this post and she responded with this:
Omg wow! That was brilliant!!!!!! I think that post literally shock all the excuses out of me. Kyle you are amazing! I hope you screenshot of this e-mail :) Extremely extremely helpful for me, wow I love it. Every time I feel imposter syndrome creeping in, I’m gonna refer back to this post. Thank you so much!!! Thanks a million for this! Well here it goes….. [Update: Since posting this, there have been a ton of people commenting about their experiences with Impostor Syndrome, their stories might be even more helpful than the article itself. Definitely check them out.] I’m a fraud and everyone is about to find out. I feel that every time I am about to share something. I feel that right now writing this: I don’t even have impostor syndrome. That’s how bad my impostor syndrome is. I even think I’m faking that. If it’s part of my life, it’s fake. What is impostor syndrome? It’s feeling likean impostor when you’re not. Like you’re a fraud and the whole world is going to find you out. This makes total sense for undercover agents and people selling snake oil. It doesn’t make so much sense for people who are trying to make the world a little better or to sell something they believe in.The first step to feeling better about anything is to realize that famous people suffer the same thing.
